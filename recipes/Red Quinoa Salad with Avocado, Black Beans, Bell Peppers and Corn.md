- 1 jar Yassa sauce
- 1.5 c uncooked red Quinoa
- 1.5 c water
- 1 tbsp. oil
- 1 medium green bell pepper diced
- 1 medium red bell pepper diced
- 1 medium orange bell pepper diced
- 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 can corn drained or 1.5 c fresh or frozen corn
.- 5 c finely chopped cilantro
- juice from 2 limes
- 2 large semi-ripe avocados

1. Pour water into a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add Quinoa and oil; stir. Bring to a boil and immediately turn down to a low simmer. 1. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or until all the water is absorbed and the Quinoa is soft and tender.
1. While Quinoa is cooking, prepare the other ingredients. Peel and cut avocado into .5 inch chunks, squeeze the juice of one lime onto the avocados, gently tossing to coat all the pieces. This will prevent it from darkening and oxidation. Store in the refrigerator for later use.
1. Pour Yassa sauce into a large mixing bowl; add bell peppers, black beans, corn, cilantro and juice of remaining .5 lime. Toss together and test for salt.
1. When the Quinoa is done cooking, remove from heat source and set aside to cool for 5-10 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Add to the bowl of seasoned vegetables. Toss together well. Just before serving, fold in the avocados.
1. Serve at room temperature.
