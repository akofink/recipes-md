1. To every 100. Cacaos, you must put two cods of the*Chiles long red Pepper, of which I have spoken before, and are called in the Indian Tongue, Chilparlagua; and in stead of those of the Indies, you may take those of Spaine which are broadest, & least hot.
1. One handfull of Annis-seed Orejuelas, which are otherwise called Pinacaxlidos: and two of the ï¬‚owers, called Mechasuchil, if the Belly be bound.
1. But in stead of this, in Spaine, we put in six Roses of Alexandria beat to Powder: One Cod of Campeche, or Logwood: Two Drams of Cinamon; Almons, and Hasle-Nuts, of each one Dozen: Of white Sugar, halfe a pound: of Achiote enough to give it the colour.
1. And if you cannot have those things, which come from the Indies, you may make it with the rest.
