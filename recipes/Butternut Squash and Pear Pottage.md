*Serves 8 to 10*

#### Ingredients
- 1 large butternut squash or 2 small ones, about 4 to 5 pounds total weight
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 to 4 shallots, finely chopped (about 1/2 cup)
- 3 to 4 ripe Bartlett pears or Anjou pears, cored and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger
- 5 cups low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons heavy cream
- Finely diced pear (optional), for garnish
- Green onion (optional), rinsed and sliced, for garnish

#### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C).

2. Carefully cut the squash lengthwise through the middle and place the halves flesh-side down on a nonstick or parchment-lined baking sheet.
   Pour 2 cups water into the pan and place the pan in the center of the oven with the necks of the squash toward the back.

3. Cook the squash for about 30–35 minutes, or until the middle of the neck is soft enough to indent.
   Once cool enough to handle, peel, remove the seeds, and cut into 1-inch pieces.

4. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.
   Add the shallots and cook about 3–4 minutes, or until tender.

5. Add the cooked squash, pears, and ginger to the saucepan and cook briefly, stirring.

6. Add the broth, bring to a boil, stirring often, then reduce the heat to medium-low.
   Cover and cook, stirring often, for 25 minutes.

7. Add the salt and cayenne pepper and remove from the heat.

8. Carefully purée the soup directly in the saucepan with a stick blender if available.
   Otherwise, pour the soup through a sieve set over a large bowl.
   Place the pulp from the sieve and some of the strained soup broth into a food processor and purée in batches until smooth.
   Return the purée and remaining broth to the saucepan.

9. Simmer over medium heat, stirring often, for 5 minutes.

10. Reduce the heat to low, stir in 1 cup of the cream, and adjust seasoning to taste.
    Thin the pottage with milk if needed to reach the desired consistency.

11. Garnish with the remaining cream, diced pears, additional cayenne pepper, and green onion, if desired.
