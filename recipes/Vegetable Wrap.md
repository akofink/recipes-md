This recipe is really a template for whatever you desire in your wrap. Here's one of my favorite combinations:

* olive oil (EVOO preferred)
* seasoning (experiment!)
  * basil
  * cumin
* vegetables (experiment!)
  * garlic
  * onion
  * green pepper
  * mushrooms
  * broccoli, cut into small pieces
  * kale, ripped into small leaves
  * broccoli sprouts
  * tomato (fresh diced or sliced)
* 1 tortilla (white, wheat, spinach, etc.)

Saut√© the vegetables, starting with garlic, onions, peppers and mushrooms. Let this cook with the spices and herbs until nicely browned. Your kitchen should smell amazing by now. Throw in the broccoli and kale. Once the kale cooks down a bit, form the cold tortilla into a wrap shape, and toast in the oven for 5 minutes or so. Turn off the stove, and incorporate the sprouts and tomato. I don't like to let the tomato cook, so I immediately stuff my tortilla and indulge!

Makes 1 wrap.
