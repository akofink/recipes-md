CRANBERRY ORANGE JUICE BREAD
yield: ONE 9-INCH LOAF prep time: 10 MIN cook time: 1 HOUR
INGREDIENTS:

1 large egg, well beaten
3/4 cup orange juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 Tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 cup fresh cranberries, rinsed and thoroughly dried
1 Tablespoon turbinado sugar (optional)

DIRECTIONS:

Preheat oven to 350ÂºF. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter or cooking spray.

In a small bowl, combine the beaten egg with the orange juice and vanilla extract.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the pieces of butter to the flour, blending the ingredients together with your fingers until the mixture becomes the consistency of wet sand.

Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and then stir in the cranberries. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and sprinkle the top with the Turbinado sugar (optional).

Bake the bread for 50 to 60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
