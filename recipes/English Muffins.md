English Muffins
Serves 8

Ingredients

2 1/4 cups bread flour
1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
3/4 cup warm milk
1 tablespoon butter, softened
2 teaspoons sugar, plus 1 pinch
1 teaspoon salt
cornmeal, optional
Directions

In a small bowl or glass, gently stir yeast into warm water with 1 pinch sugar. Let rest 5-10 minutes, or until frothy and bubble. If there is no reaction, discard and start again.
In a mixer or food processor, sift together (or pulse) the flour, salt and 2 teaspoons sugar. Add in butter. Mixture will be clumpy-- this is normal. 
Gradually pour in yeast water and warm milk and mix until dough begins to form.
Note: if dough is too wet, add a little more flour; if it’s too dry, add 1-3 teaspoons water.
Once dough ball has formed, knead (using a dough hook attachment or by hand) until dough is smooth and elastic. 6-10 minutes.
Turn dough out into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean, damp towel and let rest in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size. 60-90 minutes.
Punch dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 8 balls and transfer to a cornmeal sprinkled, parchment or foil-lined baking sheet.
Cover and let rest for another 30-45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400º F.
Heat a lightly oiled oven-proof or cast-iron skillet over low heat. Place 4 dough balls in the skillet and cook until the bottoms are browned but not burned. Flip over and repeat on other side. About 5 minutes per side.
Transfer browned English muffins back to baking sheet, place in oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until muffins are cooked through.
Serve immediately or store, refrigerated, in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
