##### Pumpkin purée
1. To make pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin: start with a small-medium sugar pumpkin, cut out the stem and scrape out the insides, discard (save the seeds, of course).
1. Cut the pumpkin in half and lay cut side down on a rimmed baking sheet lined with silpat or aluminum foil.
1. Bake at 350°F until fork tender, about an hour to an hour and a half.
1. Remove from oven, let cool, scoop out the pulp.

(Alternatively you can cut the pumpkin into sections and steam in a saucepan with a couple inches of water at the bottom, until soft.)

If you want the pulp to be extra smooth, put it through a food mill or chinois.

##### Pie Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
1. Mix sugars, salt, and spices, and lemon zest in a large bowl. Beat the eggs and add to the bowl. Stir in the pumpkin purée. Stir in cream. 1. Whisk all together until well incorporated.
1. Pour into pie shell and bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes reduce the temperature to 350°F. Bake 40-50 minutes, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
