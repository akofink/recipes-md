*Serves 6*

This hearty combination of seasonal and winter vegetables is a wonderful main dish. Many types of catsup were common in early American cookbooks, including mushroom, walnut, oyster, and mussel. This variation uses the entire mushroom for a puréed sauce as opposed to eighteenth-century recipes, which called for straining the mushrooms. Make the catsup a day ahead. Also, start the wild rice about an hour before serving since it takes extra time to cook.

#### Ingredients

##### Mushroom Catsup
- 1 (8-ounce) package button or cremini mushrooms, rinsed and quartered
- 1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon mace or ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon allspice
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- Cayenne pepper, to taste
- 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

##### Stuffed Squash and Filling
- 1/2 cup wild rice, rinsed
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 large acorn squash
- 4 tablespoons plus 2 tablespoons butter, divided
- 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 cup peeled and cubed sweet potatoes
- 1 cup pearl onions
- 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and cubed
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries
- 2 small yellow squash, cubed (about 1 cup)
- 2 cups chopped fresh spinach
- 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/4 teaspoon dried ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted (about 2 ounces)

#### Instructions

##### Prepare the Mushroom Catsup
1. Purée the mushrooms, red bell pepper, salt, mace (or nutmeg), allspice, sugar,
   cayenne pepper, red wine vinegar, white wine, and olive oil in a food processor.
   Add water if necessary to ensure the ingredients mix smoothly.

2. Transfer the mixture to a heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over medium heat
   for 25–30 minutes, or until thickened and reduced by about half.

3. Allow the catsup to cool and transfer to a dressing bottle or condiment jar.
   Refrigerate and shake before using.

##### Prepare the Wild Rice
4. Place the wild rice, bay leaf, and 2 cups water in a heavy, small saucepan over high heat.
   Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, partially cover, and cook for 50–60 minutes,
   or until the wild rice has puffed.

5. Remove from the heat and allow to stand for 10 minutes.
   Drain excess water and discard the bay leaf.

##### Prepare the Squash
6. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

7. Cut the acorn squash in half lengthwise and trim the bases so they stand evenly.
   Scoop out the seeds and place 1 teaspoon of butter into each squash half.
   Sprinkle the inside and rim of each half with some salt and the brown sugar.

8. Place the squash halves in a shallow roasting pan.
   Pour 1 cup water into the pan.
   Roast for 45–50 minutes, or until just soft.
   Occasionally baste the edges of the squash with the melted brown sugar from inside.
   Remove from the oven, cover, and keep warm.

##### Prepare the Vegetable Filling
9. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter with the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
   Add the sweet potatoes and cook, stirring often, about 5–6 minutes, or until tender.

10. Increase the heat to high and add the pearl onions, apples, and cranberries.
    Cook 3–4 minutes, or until the apples begin to soften.

11. Add the yellow squash and spinach and cook, stirring, 3–4 minutes.

12. Add the remaining butter, thyme, ginger, salt, black pepper, and cooked wild rice.
    Cook for 2 minutes and add 1/2 cup water.
    Stir well and heat thoroughly.
    Adjust seasoning to taste.

13. Spoon the vegetable stuffing into the warm squash halves and sprinkle with toasted almonds.

14. Serve warm with the mushroom catsup.
