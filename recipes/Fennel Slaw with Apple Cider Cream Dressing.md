*Serves 6*

#### Ingredients
- 1 bulb fresh fennel
- 1 Granny Smith apple
- 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup grated green cabbage
- 1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
- 3 green onions, rinsed and finely chopped (about 2 tablespoons)
- 1/4 cup apple cider
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Bibb lettuce

#### Instructions

1. Trim any outer tough stalks and bruised areas from the fennel bulb.
   Trim away the hard base and discard.
   Trim away the feathery top, reserving some of the fennel fronds for garnish.

2. Slice the fennel bulb through the middle lengthwise and cut away the core.
   With the cut side down, slice the fennel into very thin strips.

3. Peel, core, and quarter the apple and grate with a cheese grater.
   Immediately toss the grated apples with cider vinegar to prevent browning.

4. In a large bowl, combine the apple mixture, cabbage, red bell peppers, and green onions.

5. Add the apple cider, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt, and cayenne pepper.
   Stir gently to blend well.

6. Serve the slaw on fresh Bibb lettuce cups and garnish with extra diced red bell peppers
   and reserved fennel fronds.
