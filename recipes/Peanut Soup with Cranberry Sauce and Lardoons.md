*Serves 4–6*

#### Ingredients
- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter, divided
- 1 tablespoon peanut oil (from the top of stirred natural peanut butter)
- 1/2 cup finely chopped onion
- 1/2 cup finely chopped celery
- 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth
- 4 ounces Virginia ham or salt-cured country ham, cut into thin strips
- 1 cup natural peanut butter
- 1/2 cup light cream or half-and-half
- 6 heaping teaspoons whole-berry cranberry sauce
- Chopped peanuts, for garnish
- Chopped parsley (optional), for garnish

#### Instructions

1. Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter with the peanut oil in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat.

2. Add the onions and celery and cook, stirring often, 3–5 minutes, or until softened.

3. Stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes.

4. Pour in the broth, increase the heat to medium-high, and whisk constantly until smooth.
   Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer 15 minutes.

5. Meanwhile, cook the ham strips in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet
   over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, or until crisp.
   Remove and drain on paper towels.

6. Pour the broth mixture through a sieve set over a large bowl and strain, pressing on the
   solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids.

7. Add the peanut butter and cream to the broth mixture.
   Warm over low heat, stirring often, about 5 minutes, or until hot.
   Do not boil.

8. Serve in soup bowls. Garnish with cranberry sauce, several lardoons,
   chopped peanuts, and parsley, if desired.
