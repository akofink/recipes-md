#### Ingredients

- 1 cup warm water (110-115 degree F)
- 1 (1/4 –ounce) packet active dry yeast
- 2 cups All-Purpose Flour
- 1 cup cake flour (not self-rising)
- 1-1/2 teaspoon salt
- Olive oil for brushing bowl

#### Preparation Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Combine the water and yeast in a large bowl and stir until dissolved.
1. Combine the flours in a mixing bowl, using a whisk to stir. In a separate mixing bowl combine 2 cups of the flour mixture with salt, make a well in the center.
1. Pour the yeast mixture into the well and begin to incorporate the flour, pulling from the sides with a wooden spoon and stirring until it all comes together. If it becomes too sticky to handle, add an additional ½ cup of flour and incorporate.
1. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and incorporate the remaining ½ to 1 cup of flour, kneading and working the dough. Give the dough a one-quarter turn, again fold the sides in and push down and away with the heel of your hand. Repeat this process. Knead the dough until smooth and form a ball.
1. Coat a large mixing bowl with olive oil, place the dough ball in the bowl, turn to coat with oil, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a warm, draft-free area to rise, until double its original size.
1. Punch down the risen dough and divide in half, then use as directed. At this point, too, the dough can be placed in plastic bags and refrigerated. If using the refrigeration method, remove and bring to room temperature before proceeding. Dough can be frozen as well; after kneading the first time, place in freezer bags or containers and freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to use, thaw at room temperature or refrigerated, allow to rise double the original size, punch down, and use according to recipe directions.
