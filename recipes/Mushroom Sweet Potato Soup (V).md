Be flexible with this soup: if you really love mushrooms, then add a bunch (don't be scared to make them the feature of this dish). If you just want them as an afterthought, then add more sweet potatoes. It's hard to go wrong. The sage, thyme, and rosemary give this soup a homey feeling

#### Ingredients
* Extra virgin olive oil
* An onion of your choosing (I prefer sweet)
* Minced garlic or garlic power in a pinch
* 1-2 quarts of any variety of mushrooms (shitake, portabella, etc.)
* 2-3 quarts of vegetable or other broth
* 1-2 quarts of any variety of sweet potatoes, cut up with the skins left on (or off if you prefer, but the skins add a great taste and texture to the soup)
* Rosemary to taste
* Thyme to taste
* Sage to taste

#### Directions
1. Chop up the onion and sautée it with the minced garlic in the bottom of a large stock pot until it is nearly fully caramelized.
1. Add the mushrooms, cut to your preferred size, and continue to sautée until the mushrooms become a bit browned.
1. Add the broth and sweet potatoes and some initial seasoning.
1. Let simmer, and continue to season to taste until the whole house smells like home cooking
