Ingredients - 

For the dough:

* 3 1/2c all purpose flour
* 1 1/4c warm water
* 1 Tbsp active dry yeast
* 1/2tsp sea salt
* 1/3c  + 1 tsp organic sugar
* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* extra oil for greasing the bowl

For the sticky bun filling:

* 1/4c vegan butter, at room temperature
* 1/3c packed light brown sugar
* 2 Tbsp ground cinnamon
* extra butter for greasing the baking dish

Directions -

1. Measure 1 1/4c warm water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.  (If mixing by hand, use a bowl)
2. Sprinkle in the yeast and 1tsp of the organic sugar and whisk to combine.
3. Allow yeast mixture to proof for 10 minutes or until frothy.
4. Add flour, remaining 1/3c of sugar, sea salt and olive oil to the bowl.
5. Mix at low to medium low speed for approximately 8-10 minutes.  You may need to stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the dough off of the hook or the sides of the bowl. (Or mix with a wooden spoon)
  * The dough should be smooth, elastic, not sticky and  pull away easily from the bowl.
If  too dry, add water a few drops at a time.
If too wet, add extra flour a pinch at a time.
6. Once dough is mixed, roughly form it into a ball and place in a large well oiled bowl.  The dough will roughly double, so be sure your bowl is large enough.
7. Cover with a tea towel or plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm dry place (inside of an unheated oven with the light on works perfectly) for 1 hour.
8. Grease an 8" square glass or ceramic baking dish, and preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
9. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roughly shape into a rectangle with your hands.
10. Use a lightly floured rolling pin and roll dough out until it is about 1/4" thick, maintaining the rectangular shape of the dough. 
11. Using your hands, spread the 1/4c of butter over the surface of the dough. 
  * It is ok if there are larger bits of butter here and there, just make sure that the butter covers the entire surface of the dough, up to the edges. 
12. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the butter covered dough, covering the entire surface, then do the same with the ground cinnamon. 
13. Roll the dough, from the longer end, into a tight cylinder. 
  * Do not apply much pressure to the dough while rolling, just make sure it is tight enough where all of the layers are touching.
14. Use a pastry cutter or sharp knife to divide the rolled dough into 9 equal sized pieces.
15. Place the pieces into prepared baking dish and bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown on top.
