- 1 tablespoon oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 teaspoon cumin, ground
- 2 cups tomatoes, diced or 1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 2-4 habanero chilies, chopped, add more to taste, I always do.
- 1 handful cilantro, chopped (about the entire bunch)
- 1/2 lime, juice

1. Heat the oil in a pan.
1. Add the onions and saute until tender, about 5-7 minutes.
1. Add the garlic and cumin and saute until fragrant, about a minute. 1. Add the tomatoes and chilies, stir in the cilantro and hit it with a squeeze of lime juice.
1. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until the sauce thickens about 10-20 minutes.
1. Remove from heat, let cool some, then placed in glass jars.

I double the recipe and it makes about 32 ounces, store in glass jars in the refrigerator and it lasts for several weeks.
