## Instructions

1. Prepare the pie dough, adding the black pepper and paprika into the sifted flour and salt.
   If using a premade piecrust, press the black pepper and paprika into the crust.

2. Melt the butter with the olive oil in a medium-sized heavy-duty skillet over medium-high heat.

3. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, 3–5 minutes, or until softened.
   Transfer the onions to a large mixing bowl.

4. Gently blend the cream cheese and onions with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth.

5. Mix in the artichokes into the cream cheese mixture using a wooden spoon.

6. Stir in the eggs, cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, green onions, salt, and cayenne pepper until thoroughly mixed.

7. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).

8. Roll out the dough onto a floured surface large enough to line a deep-dish–style 9-inch pie pan and decoratively crimp the edges.

9. Refrigerate until the oven is fully preheated.

10. Place the artichoke mixture into the dough-lined piecrust.

11. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350°F (175°C).
    Bake about 35–40 additional minutes, or until it is golden brown and the center of the pie is just set.

12. Cool on a wire rack.
    Serve warm with toast rounds or crackers as an hors d’oeuvre, or cut into small wedges as an individual serving.
