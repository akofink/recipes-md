1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook onions and carrots until vegetables are softened. Stir in garlic, and cook for another minute, stirring constantly so garlic doesn’t burn.
1. Add water or broth, cannellini beans, tomatoes, potatoes, green beans, kale, basil, parsley, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, over low heat about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
