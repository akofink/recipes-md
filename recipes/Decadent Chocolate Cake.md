- 3 oz unsweetened chocolate
- 8 tbsp sweet butter
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 2 eggs, separated
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 cup dairy sour cream
- 2 cups less 2 tbsp unbleached, all-purpose flour, sifted

#### Chocolate Frosting Ingredients

- 3/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 6 tbsp heavy cream
- 1 1/4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar, or as needed
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

#### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan. Knock out excess.
2. Pour boiling water over chocolate and butter; let stand until melted. Stir in vanilla and sugar, then whisk in egg yolks, one at a time, blending well after each addition.
3. Mix baking soda and sour cream and whisk into chocolate mixture.
4. Sift flour and baking powder together and add to batter, mixing thoroughly.
5. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Stir a quarter of the egg whites thoroughly into the batter. Scoop remaining egg whites on top of the batter and gently fold together.
6. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Set on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the edges have pulled away from the sides of the pan and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes; unmold and cool completely before frosting.
