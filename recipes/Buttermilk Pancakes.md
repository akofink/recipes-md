Yield: About 16 pancakes (4 servings)
Time: 20 to 30 minutes

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole-wheat flour, or more all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups buttermilk
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil or peanut oil
- Oil or butter for cooking the pancakes
- Butter and maple syrup for serving

1. Put a large skillet over medium heat, or heat a griddle to medium. Whisk together the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the eggs in a separate large bowl, then stir in the buttermilk and oil. Add the flour mixture to the buttermilk mixture and stir just until combined; the batter should be lumpy.
2. Put about a tablespoon of oil or butter in the skillet or on the griddle. When it’s hot, begin to pour the batter, a scant ¼ cup at a time, into the skillet or onto the griddle; try not to let the pancakes touch one another. When the bottom of the pancakes are golden brown, the edges are firm, and the tops are bubbly, after about 3 minutes, flip the pancakes and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil or butter to the skillet or griddle for each batch. Serve hot with butter and maple syrup.
