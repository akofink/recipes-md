- Extra Virgin Olive Oil (or any other kind of oil you prefer)
- Veggies to sauté (e.g. onion, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli)
- Leafy greens (e.g. kale, spinach, arugula)
- Eggs
- Fresh veggies to sprinkle over the eggs (e.g. tomato, avocado)
- Shredded cheese of your choosing (e.g. Mexican 4 cheese, feta)

1. In a skillet that is oven-safe (I prefer cast iron), sauté the veggies with olive oil, by order of cook time. Onions and peppers take a while, mushrooms a little less, broccoli even less, so start with onions, and caramelize to your liking.
1. Preheat the oven to 350F
1. Reduce the heat, and add a generous handful of greens. Cover the skillet with a lid; the remaining moisture in the sauté veggies will steam the greens. This only takes about 5-10 minutes, depending on the stiffness of the greens (kale takes the longest, spinach cooks quickly).
1. Whisk the eggs, either separated (for a fluffier quiche) or together. You may add milk for a creamier mixture. If you separate the eggs, whip the whites to a froth: the stiffer the whites, the fluffier the quiche. There is no way to over-whip the whites. Once stiff, recombine the yolks and any milk you wish to add. Wait until the skillet is cooler (sizzling veggies isn't audible) before pouring the egg mixture in. If you layer the veggie mixture to completely cover the bottom of the pan, it will prevent the eggs from sticking.
1. Now sprinkle any fresh veggies over the eggs, and sprinkle as much cheese as you wish on top.
1. Place the whole thing in the oven, and cook until the quiche is set. You can reach in and give the skillet a shake: if it moves, keep baking. The cook time is different for different sized pans. 40 minutes is a rough estimate for a 6 inch round pan.
