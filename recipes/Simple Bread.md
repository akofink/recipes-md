This bread is a great starting place for anyone wanting to learn how to bake bread. [Here](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/lessons/yourfirstloaf) is the original lesson/recipe.

- 3 cups flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons yeast
- 1 1/8 cup water

1. Mix everything together. If it is too wet and won't come free from the sides of the bowl or keeps sticking to your hands, add a little more flour. If it is too dry and won't form into a ball, add a bit of water.
1. Knead it for 10 minutes. Cover and set it aside to rise until it doubles in size, approximately 90 minutes. Punch it down and let it rise again. Shape it, either by putting it in a greased loaf pan or by rolling it out into a long loaf and putting it on the back of a cookie sheet.
1. After it has risen to twice it size again, another hour or so, put the loaf into a preheated oven at 375 degrees. Let it bake for 45 minutes and then pull it out. If you made it into a long skinny loaf, it may cook 5 or 10 minutes quicker, so adjust the time based on what shape you chose. I baked the loaf in these photos for 40 minutes). 50-375 for 45 minutes is typical for a loaf in a loaf pan.
