- 2 medium sweet onions, diced (like Vidalia, Walla Walla etc. They have light coloured skin and a slightly flattened top and bottom)
- 5 cloves of garlic, minced
- 10 oz./283 g package of mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tsp fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried)
- 6 large stalks of celery, leaves removed and sliced
- 4 large carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1 lb/454 g (1/2 head) of green cabbage, shredded or cut with mandolin
- 28 oz/793 g (or 2 16oz cans) fire roasted diced tomatoes (I use Muir Glen Organics)
- 10 cups/2.5 qtss/2.3 L fresh vegetable broth (my recipes are here) or low sodium packaged vegetable broth
Herbamare/Salt and pepper to taste

1. Saute onions, garlic and mushrooms in 2-3 cups of vegetable broth for 5-6 minutes until the onions are tender. (Mushrooms take longer to cook than the rest of the veggies, so we’re cooking them first.)
1. Add the rest of the vegetables, the thyme, the canned tomatoes, and the vegetable broth.
1. Cook the vegetables over medium heat for 30-40 minutes or low heat for 1.5-2 hours until the vegetables are tender.
1. Season to taste with Herbamare or salt and pepper. Add a little cayenne or chili pepper if you like the soup spicy. If you like your soup a little thinner you can add a little more vegetable broth or water if desired. But don’t add too much or you will dilute the flavour.
1. Serve!
