- 3 ounces dried soba noodles
- 2 - 4 tablespoons miso paste (to taste) 
- 2 - 3 ounces firm tofu (2 handfuls), chopped into 1/3-inch cubes
- a handful of watercress or spinach, well washed and stems trimmed
- 2 green onions, tops removed thinly sliced
- a small handful of cilantro
- a pinch of red pepper flakes

1. Cook the soba noodles in salted water, drain, run cold water over the noodles to stop them from cooking, shake off any excess water and set aside.
1. In a medium sauce pan bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and remove from heat. Pour a bit of the hot water into a small bowl and whisk in the miso paste - so it thins out a bit (this step is to avoid clumping). Stir this back into the pot. Taste, and then add more (the same way) a bit at a time until it is to your liking. Also, some miso pastes are less-salty than others, so you may need to add a bit of salt here. Add the tofu, remove from the heat, and let it sit for just a minute or so.
1. Split the noodles between two (or three) bowls, and pour the miso broth and tofu over them. Add some watercress, green onions, cilantro, and red pepper flakes to each bowl and enjoy.

Serves 2 - 3.
